    faq: [
      { q: 'What size booster pump do I need for a 3-bedroom house?', a: 'For a typical 3-bedroom South African home with 2 bathrooms, you need a pump delivering 40–60 L/min at 30–40m head. An inverter-driven unit like the DAB E.SYBOX Mini 3 or Grundfos SCALA2 handles this comfortably while maintaining consistent pressure even when multiple taps run simultaneously.' },
      { q: 'Can I use a booster pump with a JoJo tank?', a: 'Absolutely. Booster pumps are commonly paired with JoJo or similar storage tanks to pressurise water for household use. Connect the tank outlet to the pump inlet, and the pump delivers pressurised water throughout your home. Ensure your pump has dry-run protection in case the tank empties.' },
      { q: 'What is the difference between a peripheral and an inverter booster pump?', a: 'Peripheral pumps are simple, affordable units that run at a fixed speed — ideal for basic single-tap applications. Inverter booster pumps adjust their motor speed to match demand, delivering constant pressure regardless of how many outlets are open. Inverter units are quieter, more energy-efficient, and better suited to whole-house installations.' },
      { q: 'Do booster pumps use a lot of electricity?', a: 'Modern inverter booster pumps are highly efficient, typically consuming 0.37–0.8 kW. They only run when water is flowing, and variable-speed models reduce power consumption during low demand. Monthly running costs are minimal — comparable to a few light bulbs.' },

    h2: 'Versatile Underwater Pumping for Drainage, Wells & Water Features',
    intro: `Submersible pumps are designed to operate while fully or partially immersed in water, making them the go-to choice for applications ranging from garden features and rainwater harvesting to construction-site dewatering and sewage drainage. SWSG stocks a range of submersible units suited to South African conditions — from compact 55-watt fountain pumps for garden ponds through to heavy-duty drainage pumps with float switches rated for dirty water and solids handling. Our submersible range includes clean-water models for pressurisation from tanks and wells, as well as dirty-water variants built to handle suspended particles, sand, and silt. Key features across our range include corrosion-resistant housings, thermal overload protection, and long submersible cable lengths for deep installations. Whether you need to drain a flooded basement, circulate water through a feature, or draw from a shallow well, we have a submersible pump to match. Not sure if you need a submersible or a borehole pump? As a rule of thumb, submersibles work best in open water or shallow wells under 20m, while borehole pumps are purpose-built for narrow deep wells.`,

    faq: [
      { q: 'Can I use a submersible pump in a borehole?', a: 'Standard submersible pumps are designed for open water sources, tanks, and shallow wells. For boreholes deeper than 10–15m with narrow casings, you need a dedicated borehole pump with the correct diameter (3" or 4") to fit inside the casing. Check our Borehole Pumps category for purpose-built models.' },
      { q: 'What does the float switch do on a submersible pump?', a: 'A float switch automatically turns the pump on when water rises above a set level and off when it drops below. This prevents the pump from running dry, which would damage the motor. It is essential for unattended drainage applications like sump pits or construction sites.' },
      { q: 'How deep can a submersible pump be installed?', a: 'Standard domestic submersible pumps operate at depths of 1–10 metres. The maximum depth depends on the cable length and the pump\'s head rating. For depths beyond 15m, consider a dedicated borehole pump designed for deep-well operation.' },

    intro: `Borehole pumps are engineered to extract water from narrow, deep wells — a critical water source for South African farms, smallholdings, game lodges, and residential estates that sit beyond reliable municipal supply. Our range spans from economical 3-inch multi-stage units suitable for domestic boreholes up to 70m depth, through to solar-compatible systems from Grundfos that power remote installations entirely off-grid. Every borehole pump we stock is constructed from stainless steel and corrosion-resistant materials, built to withstand the abrasive conditions found in South African geological formations. Features include built-in check valves to prevent backflow, sand guards to protect against fine sediment, and multi-stage impellers that deliver high head pressure from considerable depths. Selecting the correct borehole pump requires knowing your borehole diameter, static water level, required yield, and total dynamic head. If you have a driller's report, send it through to us and we'll size the right pump for your installation. We also stock the control boxes, cables, and accessories needed for a complete borehole installation — browse our Accessories section for these.`,

    faq: [
      { q: 'How do I know what size borehole pump I need?', a: 'You need three key numbers from your driller\'s report: borehole diameter, static water level, and tested yield. The pump diameter must fit your casing, its head rating must exceed the static level plus friction losses, and its flow rate must not exceed the borehole yield. Send us your driller\'s report and we\'ll size it for free.' },
      { q: 'Can I run a borehole pump on solar power?', a: 'Yes. The Grundfos SQFlex range is specifically designed for solar and wind power. It accepts 30–300V DC from solar panels or 90–240V AC from a generator or inverter. This makes it ideal for off-grid farms, lodges, and rural homesteads across South Africa.' },
      { q: 'How long does a borehole pump last?', a: 'Quality stainless-steel borehole pumps from brands like DAB and Grundfos typically last 8–15 years depending on water quality, run time, and correct sizing. Sand, iron, and low-pH water accelerate wear. Regular monitoring of flow rate and power consumption helps detect early signs of degradation.' },
      { q: 'What is the difference between a 3-inch and 4-inch borehole pump?', a: 'The measurement refers to the motor diameter. A 3" pump fits boreholes with a minimum 90mm casing — common in domestic and narrow drilled holes. A 4" pump requires a minimum 100mm casing and is typically used in larger agricultural or commercial boreholes where higher flow rates are needed.' },

  'self-priming-pumps': {
    h1: 'Self-Priming Pumps',
    h2: 'Reliable Water Transfer & Irrigation Pumps That Prime Themselves',
    intro: `Self-priming pumps eliminate the hassle of manual priming — they automatically draw water from a source up to 8 metres below the pump, making them perfect for installations where the pump sits above the water level. This is the most common setup for irrigation from dams and rivers, transfer from JoJo tanks, and pressure boosting from ground-level reservoirs. SWSG stocks a selected range of self-priming pumps from DAB and Zilmet, chosen for their robust construction and reliable suction capability in South African conditions. Our range includes compact 0.75 kW domestic units ideal for 2–3 taps, as well as larger 1 kW centrifugal models that handle irrigation duties with flow rates up to 80 L/min. Cast-iron housings and technopolymer impellers deliver durability while keeping weight manageable for surface-mounted installations. Self-priming pumps are an excellent choice when you need a surface-mounted unit that can pull water from a tank, dam, or well without needing the pump to sit below the water line. Pair them with an automatic pressure controller for hands-free operation that starts the pump when a tap opens and stops it when flow ceases.`,

    faq: [
      { q: 'How high can a self-priming pump suck water?', a: 'Most self-priming pumps can draw water from up to 7–8 metres below the pump level. This is a physical limitation based on atmospheric pressure. If your water source is deeper than 8m, you\'ll need a submersible or borehole pump installed below the water line.' },
      { q: 'Do I need a controller with a self-priming pump?', a: 'If you want the pump to start and stop automatically when you open or close a tap, yes. A pressure controller detects when pressure drops (tap opened) and starts the pump, then stops it when pressure builds back up (tap closed). Without a controller, you must manually switch the pump on and off.' },
      { q: 'Can I use a self-priming pump for irrigation?', a: 'Absolutely. Self-priming pumps are one of the most popular choices for garden and smallholding irrigation in South Africa. They work well drawing from JoJo tanks, reservoirs, and dams. Choose a model with sufficient flow rate for your sprinkler or drip system requirements.' },
